A randomly generated chess game. Written in python.

## Notes
-This is only for Juypter Notebook, and "visualizer.ipynb" is the main file. Run that file.

-It outputs the SVG of the final move of the game and stops once there is a stalemate (by the 50 move rule) or checkmate.

-It also outputs the PGN, which is a pastable format for chess games.
